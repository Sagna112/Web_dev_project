A tribute webpage honours someone you admire and find inspiring. 
To make a tribute page, you only need a basic understanding of HTML concepts. 

Then you can include the person's biography, accomplishments, 
and a picture of the honoree. You're more than welcome to 
add some encouraging remarks to your 
letter as well. Using CSS for this project will be useful
because it will let you incorporate different styles and layouts.
